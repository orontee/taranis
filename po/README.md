# Translations

Contributions welcome!

## Howto

People interested in contributing to translations should use the
corresponding [Weblate
project](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/taranis/taranis/).

## Limitations

Note that OpenWeather APIs are partially translated: Depending on the
requested language, returned texts are translated or not. For example,
when requesting data in French, weather descriptions are translated
but alerts aren't. And Taranis has no knowledge of the possible alerts
text…

Another limitation is related to dates. They are returned in a numeric
form by OpenWeather APIs and translation of week days and month names
is performed by Taranis based on Inkview SDK facilities (C++ provides
such facilities but the corresponding locales must be installed system
wide which is not the case as far as I can see). And Inkview
translation facilities are incomplete (if not broken)... Example, in
Czech, month names aren't translated.

Inkview SDK support a limited number of languages.
