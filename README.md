## Install

1. Download the `taranis.zip` archive from the [latest
   release](https://github.com/orontee/taranis/releases/latest).
   
2. Extract the file `taranis.app` from the archive and copy that file
   to the `applications` directory of the e-book reader using a USB
   cable.

Optionally, a custom icon can be associated to the application;
Instructions are given in [Desktop
integration](./docs/desktop_integration.md).

## Configuration

The application stores the user preferences (unit system, API key,
etc.) in a configuration file writen under `system/config/taranis.cfg`
(path may vary depending on the use of profiles).

One can add `start_with_daily_forecast = true` to the configuration file
to have the application start with the daily forecast.

Note that the Openweather API key distributed with the application is
rate limited. The `api_key` keyword in the configuration file can be
used to specify a custom key (See
[OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org) for instructions on how to
register and generate API keys).

Instructions to install an unreleased version, debug, etc. can be
