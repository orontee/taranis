## Install

1. Download the `taranis.zip` archive from the [latest
   release](https://github.com/orontee/taranis/releases/latest).
   
2. Extract the file `taranis.pbi` from the archive and copy that file
   to the e-book reader.
   
3. The downloaded file will appear as a book in the library. Open that
   book to start the installation process.
   
4. After the installation, the "book" can be suppressed from the
   library and the device.

Optionally, a custom icon can be associated to the application;
Instructions are given in [Desktop
integration](./docs/desktop_integration.md#application-icon).

## Configuration

Note that the Openweather API key distributed with the application is
rate limited. A custom API key can be specified through the
"Parametersâ€¦" menu item (See [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org)
for instructions on how to register and generate API keys).

Another parameter allows to enable/disable generation of a shutdown
logo. Instructions are given in [Desktop
integration](./docs/desktop_integration.md#shutdown-logo) on how to
setup the device to effectively display this logo on power off.
